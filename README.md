# Student-performance
This repo is about basic data analysis, EDA, and simple ML algorithms. Here linear and Support vector Regression is used to predict the score.

What the project is about?

The main objective of this project is to understand the influence of the parent's background, test preparation, lunch, gender, etc on students' performance. Dataset copied directly from Kaggle. Then predict the score..



What is the task?

The task is to build an algorithm that automatically suggests the score in math, reading, writing, and total score individually. Here dataset has 1000 students' parent's educational background, how was test preparation, what about lunch, and was gender.

What action did I take?

To predict the score, analyzed data, visualized data, and measure  the performance using different machine learning algorithms. The actions were well described and demonstrated in the codes. 

Codes

Student performance.ipynb: Load dataset then analysis dataset.
Changing column value then finding correlation between all columns.

predict_math_score.ipynb: Making feature set then using Support Vector Regression and Linear Regression to predict math score.

predict_reading_score.ipynb: simillar works to predict reading score.

predict_writing_score.ipynb: simillar works to predict writing score.

predict_total_score.ipynb: simillar works to predict total score.

What could be done in the future?

Using creative techniques to ensemble.

Using differnt regression algorithm and observe the performance

Using lasso regression
